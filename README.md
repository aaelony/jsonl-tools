# JSONL Tools

The intention is a utility that can:

 - [X] analyze a [JSONL format](https://jsonlines.org/) file where it is expected that a JSON document of any length occupies 1 row and there are N rows in the file.
 - [X] report on unique JSON keys found
 - [X] report counts of values found per JSON key found
 - [ ] Report number of lines found and the percentage with missing keys.
 - [ ] Identify lines (rows) with missing JSON keys
 - [ ] Provide a way to edit (CRUD) a row by adding needed key/value pairs interactively.
